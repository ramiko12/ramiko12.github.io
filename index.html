When a given user owned two leases and uploaded two unique documents that had the same name to each lease (one document to each lease), the first uploaded document would be overwritten because both document records shared the exact same path.

<p> . The triPathSY field must be part of the organization and of all geography business objects.</p>
<p> . The values of triPathSY fields on organizations and all geography records must be consistent with the hierarchy structure.</p>

When the GEO_ORG_SECURITY_CONTRIBUTE_BEHAVIOR=PATH is in the TRIRIGAWEB.properties file for DB2 and Oracle environments,

Database Manager, Database Admin Tasks, select "Check Organization Hierarchy" or "Check Geography Hierarchy". 
Read the popup and click OK to confirm. This tool may take a long time to run depending on the size of your organization
